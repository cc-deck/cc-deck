# Specification Quality Checklist: Single Binary Merge

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The spec references specific file names (`cc_deck.wasm`, `permissions.kdl`, `config.kdl`) which are domain terminology for this project, not implementation details.
- One assumption depends on external confirmation (Zellij maintainer response on zellij-org/zellij#4982) but the spec documents this dependency clearly.
